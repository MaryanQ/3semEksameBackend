Music Store is a modern web application built as part of a 24-hour exam project for KEA. The system is designed to manage music albums, customer registrations, and notifications for vinyl record availability.

The backend is powered by Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, and a MySQL database, while the frontend is a standalone application developed using React and TypeScript, communicating with the backend through REST APIs.
